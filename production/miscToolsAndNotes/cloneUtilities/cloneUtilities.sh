# This is a handy utility to use on Hudson that makes a
# shallow clone of the master branch of the
# eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator
# project for the purpose of using the utilities in the
# "production" directory. It clones into a directory named
# 'utilities' to help emphasize we are not using it for the
# main build or making use of its submodules.

# This one file can be retrieved with
#   wget http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/plain/production/miscToolsAndNotes/cloneUtilities/cloneUtilities.sh
# and then chmod +x cloneUtilities.sh
# and then executed with ./cloneUtilities.sh
# It is best to remove 'cloneUtilities.sh' and wget it each
# time in case it itself changes.

# This "localBuildProperties" file is not for production runs.
# It is only for local testing, where some key locations or hosts may be
# defined differently.
