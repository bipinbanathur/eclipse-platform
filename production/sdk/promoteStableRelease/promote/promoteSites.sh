# Utility to rename build and "promote" it to DL Server.
# This promoteSites.sh script is primarily to collect (and validate) the needed values, 
# and then calls promoteSitesCore.sh to initiate the main work (which calls 
# many other scripts). 

# This has been designed to work "on Hudson" or from terminal console -- 
# but does assume the builds and build repository on on "/shared/eclipse/...". 
# On Hudson, the job must be defined as a parameterized job, with the parameters 
# in this file defined with the same names as in this file. 
# From a command line, the script can be ran, or tested, with something similar to 
#  DROP_ID=I20160602-0112 CHECKPOINT=RC4 SIGNOFF_BUG="" TRAIN_NAME=Oxygen STREAM=4.7.0 DL_TYPE=S DRYRUN=false ./promoteSites.sh


# These first three variables DROP_ID, CHECKPOINT, and SIGNOFF_BUG 
# change each time.

# That is, the FROM build. The TO name is computed from it, 
# and a few other variables.
